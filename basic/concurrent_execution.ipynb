    "# Concurrent Execution  \n",

    "## Abstraction\n",
    "The execution of a concurrent program consists of multiple processes active at the same time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each process is the execution of a sequential program. A process progresses by submitting a sequence of instructions to a processor for execution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If the computer has multiple processors then instructions from a number of processes, equal to the number of physical processors, can be executed at the same time. This is sometimes referred to as parallel or real concurrent execution.   \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is usual to have more active processes than processors. In this case, the available processors are switched between processes.\n",
